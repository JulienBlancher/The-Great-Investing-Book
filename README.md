# The Great Investing Book
The objective of this book is to implement a rigorous concept to manage an investment portfolio.  
It aims to promote analysis to lead to pragmatic and cool-headed investing decisions.  

## Main concepts
### The Great Investing Constitution (aka The Constitution)
The Constitution holds the main commandments, which shall never be offended.  
### The Great Investing Laws (aka The Laws)
The Laws define investing rules and processes.  
They are updated and enriched as our experience in investment progresses.  
They shall always respect the Constitution. 
A law is the definition of a specific process (i.e. Dollar-Cost-Averaging). It describes how this investing-related action shall be executed when needed.  

### The Great Investing Strategy (aka The Strategy)
The Strategy is the current investing strategy applied to a specific portfolio.  
It refers to several laws and defines common portfolio features (distribution, supports, targeted markets and companies,...)
